				<p class="padding_30">OpenEyes Technologies, Inc. (“OpenEyes Technologies”) is committed to protecting
					the privacy and security of the data of its clients and associates (hereafter, “Users”). We want you
					to understand how we collect and use information through our products and services (hereafter,
					“Site”) so you can interact with OpenEyes Technologies with confidence. By using OpenEyes
					Technologies’s Site you accept and agree to the practices this Privacy Policy describes</p>

				<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
				<p class="padding_15">When you use our Site, we may collect and use personally identifiable information
					about you, as well as other information. More specifically, when you use our Site, we may collect
					the following information. Please note a “Student” is an individual who is using our one or more
					“Site”:</p>
				<p class="padding_30">Information relating to your education, including an educational institution’s
					name, student’s name, the name of the student’s parent or other family members especially if the
					student is minor, the address of the student or student’s family especially if the student is minor,
					personal identifiers such as the student number or biometric record[1], other indirect identifiers,
					such as student’s date of birth, other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or
					linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the community, who does not
					have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable
					certainty, or information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably
					believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates, as well as other
					personally identifiable information about other customers or employees, including, but not limited
					to, driver’s license number or state-issued identification card number, financial account number,
					credit card number, or debit card number with or without any required security code, access code,
					personal identification number or password, that would permit access to an individual’s financial
					account.</p>

				<h4>Use of Your Information</h4>
				<p class="padding_15">We use the information we collect from you primarily to enable us to provide our
					services in the best possible manner. In addition, your information may be used for the following
					purposes: </p>

				<ul class="list_li margin_li">
					<li>To present our Site and its contents to you;
					</li>
					<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us;
					</li>
					<li>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it;
					</li>
					<li>To provide you with notices about your account;
					</li>
					<li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into
						between you and us, including for billing and collection;
					</li>
					<li>To notify you about changes to our Site or any products or services we offer or provide though
						it;
					</li>
					<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our Site;
					</li>
					<li>To administer our Site, including by monitoring and analyzing our Site traffic and usage
						patterns;
					</li>
					<li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information;
					</li>
					<li>For any other purpose with your consent;
					</li>
					<li>As otherwise described to you when collecting your personal information; or
					</li>
					<li>To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or
						other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of
						bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about
						our consumers is among the assets transferred.
					</li>

				</ul>

				<h4>Security</h4>
				<p class="padding_30">We use commercially suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
					safeguard and secure the information we collect. These procedures include, but are not limited to,
					firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection, and Site monitoring. We also limit access to any
					personally identifiable information we receive to staff who need access to that information in order
					to do their jobs. However, no data protection procedures are entirely infallible. As a result, while
					we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that it will be
					100% secure. Your transmission of your data to our Site thus is done entirely at your own risk.</p>

				<h4>Sharing You Information</h4>
				<p class="padding_15">We may share your personal information as follows:</p>
				<p class="padding_15">Generally:&nbsp;We may share your personal information with trusted third parties
					or our affiliates to assist us in providing our service (a “Business Purpose”), including by acting
					on our behalf to process credit card payments and provide customer assistance. Such third parties
					have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions, but they are not allowed
					to use it for other purposes. When we disclose personal information for a Business Purpose, we enter
					a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal
					information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. We share
					your personal information with the following categories of third parties:</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li_15">
					<li>Service providers for the processing and storage of digital data
					</li>
					<li>Service providers for the processing and storage of voice data
					</li>
					<li>Service providers for the processing and storage of credit card data
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="padding_15">We do not sell or rent personal information collected through OpenEyes
					Technologies’s Site to anyone.
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">Other Circumstances:&nbsp;We may disclose your personal information to third
					parties if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of any or all of our business and/or
					our assets to a third party, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li">
					<li>Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process (such as a subpoena), or lawful requests
						by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
					</li>
					<li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations of such
						Terms, or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;
					</li>
					<li>Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of OpenEyes Technologies, our Users, or
						the public as required or permitted by law; and/or
					</li>
					<li>Comply with Student Privacy Pledge that allows parental access to, and correction of errors in,
						their children’s information when Users under 18 years of age interact with our system
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Third Party Websites and Social Media Features</h4>
				<p class="padding_30">OpenEyes Technologies’s Site may contain links to other sites, including those of
					third parties or business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high
					standards and respect for privacy, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices other websites
					use. By accessing other third-party websites or applications through our Site, you are consenting to
					the terms and privacy policies of those websites. It is possible that other parties may collect
					personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different
					websites when you use OpenEyes Technologies’s Site.

					companies with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information
					about the companies’ sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing
					purposes. OpenEyes Technologies does not share any California consumer personal information with
					third parties for marketing purposes without consent. California Users who wish to request further

					verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion 0), we will
					delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records,

					necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li_15">
					<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or

						relationship with us.
					</li>
					<li>Comply with a legal obligation.
					</li>
					<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in
						which you provided it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above,
					please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li_15">
					<li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto: info@TheOpenEyes.com">info@TheOpenEyes.com</a>
					</li>
					<li>Visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theopeneyes.com/">OpenEyes Technologies</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="padding_15">Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a
					verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable
					consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for
					access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li_15">
					<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
						we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include the user’s
						first name, last name, &amp; email address.
					</li>
					<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,
						and respond to it.
					</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="padding_15">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
					cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
					relates to you.
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
					with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently
					verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to
					verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
				</p>
				<h5>Response Timing and Format
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within sixty (60) days of
					its receipt. If we require more time (up to 60 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
					period in writing.</p>
				<p class="padding_15">If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that
					account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or
					electronically, at your option.</p>
				<p class="padding_15">Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the
					verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
					cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
					to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
					information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
				<p class="padding_15">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request
					unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request
					warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate
					before completing your request.</p>
				<h5>Non-Discrimination</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
					Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
				</p>
				<ul class="list_li margin_li_15">
					<li>Deny you goods or services.
					</li>
					<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts
						or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
					</li>
					<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
					</li>
					<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
						level or quality of goods or services.
					</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="padding_30">However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that&nbsp;can
					result&nbsp;in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we
					offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that
					describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires
					your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
				</p>
				<h4>APENDIX B</a></h4>
				<h5>European Union and European Economic Area Resident Privacy Notice
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">For OpenEyes Technologies, consumer privacy is one of the most important tenets of our business.
					OpenEyes Technologies complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S.
					Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
					transferred from the European Union to the United States. OpenEyes Technologies’s participation in
					the Privacy Shield is part of compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679
					(“GDPR”). OpenEyes Technologies has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
					Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the
					Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the
					Privacy Shield program, and to view our Certification please visit <a
						href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov.</a>
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies may receive, maintain, or transmit personal information (“PI”) (as defined
					below) in its course of business.
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">PI includes, but is not limited to, an educational institution’s name, student’s name, the name of
					the student’s parent or other family members, the address of the student or student’s family,
					personal identifier such as the student number or biometric record, other indirect identifiers, such
					as student’s date of birth, other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable
					to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not
					have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable
					certainty, or information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably
					believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates, as well as other
					personally identifiable information about other customers or employees, including, but not limited
					to, driver’s license number or state-issued identification card number, financial account number,
					credit card number, or debit card number with or without any required security code, access code,
					personal identification number or password, that would permit access to an individual’s financial
					account.
				</p>
				<h5>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies informs individuals about the purpose for which it collects and uses
					information about them, how to contact the organization with inquiries or complaints, the choices
					and means OpenEyes Technologies offers individuals for limiting its use and disclosure, and how it
					is secured. This Notice is provided in a clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first
					asked to provide personal information while creating their profiles.
				</p>
				<h5>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies does not intend to disclose customer’s personal information with a third party
					or use the collected information for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which
					this information was originally collected. If OpenEyes Technologies wishes to disclose personal
					information collected to a third party, appropriate notice and choice will be issued to the
					individuals for whom the personal information pertains to.
				</p>
				<h5>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Security
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies understands the need for security of personal data and has taken adequate
					measures to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
					destruction.
				</p>
				<h5>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Integrity
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">Personal information collected by OpenEyes Technologies is relevant for the purpose for which it is
					to be used. OpenEyes Technologies does not process or use personal information in a way that is
					incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the
					individual. OpenEyes Technologies’s staff are thoroughly briefed on using personal data in a manner
					consistent with OpenEyes Technologies’s privacy policy before granting access to personal
					information.
				</p>
				<h5>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access, Correction, and Deletion
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies ensures that individuals have access to the personal data they have provided to
					OpenEyes Technologies. Individuals will be able to correct, amend, or delete that information,
					except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the
					individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the rights of persons other than the individual
					would be violated, or as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. OpenEyes Technologies employs role-based
					permissions to ensure adequate access and security is provided to the stored personal information.
				</p>
				<h5>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Onward Transfer
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to protect data transferred to
					third parties. OpenEyes Technologies requires such third parties to enter into contracts ensuring
					that your data is only processed for the limited and specified purposes consistent with your
					authorization. We require that the third-party recipients provide the same level of protection as
					reflected in the EU-US Privacy Shield principles as well as the GDPR and will take all reasonable
					and appropriate steps to ensure that the third-party recipient effectively processes the personal
					information. Upon request, we will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant
					privacy provisions of our contract with the third-party recipient.
				</p>
				<h5>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enforcement
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies provides recourse mechanisms to individuals to assure compliance with the EU-US
					Privacy Shield Framework. OpenEyes Technologies’s internal recourse and dispute resolution mechanism
					is comprehensive and provides a readily available, affordable and transparent way to address privacy
					concerns of individuals. OpenEyes Technologies acknowledges the possibility, under certain
					conditions, for individuals to invoke binding arbitration.
				</p>
				<p class="padding_15">Individuals with concerns or complaints regarding their privacy can reach out to our support team via
					phone, email and chat.
				</p>
				<h5>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Training
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">OpenEyes Technologies’s privacy policies and procedures shall be documented, reviewed yearly, and
					updated as necessary in response to environmental or operational changes affecting privacy of
					OpenEyes Technologies’s PI. The yearly review of documentation will be handled by the CTO’s office
					and duly signed off by senior management. In addition to the internal review, OpenEyes Technologies
					shall establish its security training to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. All
					employees of OpenEyes Technologies receive a copy of OpenEyes Technologies’s data security policies
					and procedures during the onboarding process and are expected to read and fully comply with these
					policies and procedures when performing their job duties.
				</p>
				<h5>9. Privacy Shield and GDPR Contact Point
				</h5>
				<p class="padding_15">The Chief Technology Officer of OpenEyes Technologies shall serve as the contact point for Privacy
					Shield and GDPR-related information requests, assessment and discussions.
