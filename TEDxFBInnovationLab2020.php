        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p class="padding_30">The Innovation Lab is a day-long competition hosted by OpenEyes Technologies and
          TEDxFoggyBottom with the goal of starting a project to help solve an issue in the DMV community. Each
          participant will submit a proposal in the submission box when they register for the TEDxFoggyBottom event.
          This proposal should include a description of the problem that the idea seeks to address, an explanation of
          the solution, and a plan to use the resources that OpenEyes can provide to implement this solution. After
          submitting their initial proposals, participants will be given the opportunity to pitch their ideas and answer
          questions from the judges of OpenEyes Technology during the TEDxFoggyBottom event. By the end of the event, the judges will select
          one project that OpenEyes Technologies will work with to support in turning the idea into a reality.</p>
        <h4>Event Details</h4>
        <p class="padding_15">The OpenEyes Innovation Lab will be held on April 18, 2020 on the 3rd Floor of George

          <li><b>Community Impact</b>: How much of the DMV community will be impacted by the proposed solution? What financial, legislative, or other barriers must be overcome in order for the solution to be implemented?</li>
